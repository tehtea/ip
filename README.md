1. Import the project into IntelliJ as follows:
   1. Click `Open`
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).
1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/dukchess.Duke.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run dukchess.Duke.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the output below.
